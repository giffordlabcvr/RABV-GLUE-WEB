<h2>RABV-GLUE</h2>

<p>
Rabies virus (RABV) is the virus that attacks the nervous system, causing rabies disease. 
In the wild rabies virus has been found to infect many mammalian species.
Rabies results in encephalitis in humans and other mammals and is almost always fatal in unvaccinated humans. 
</p>
<p>
The rabies virus is the type species of the Lyssavirus genus of the Rhabdoviridae family. 
These viruses are enveloped and have a single stranded, negative-sense RNA genome.

RABV-GLUE is a data-centric bioinformatics resource which organises RABV genome sequence data along evolutionary lines. 
RABV-GLUE aims to leverage new and existing RABV sequences in order to improve our understanding of the epidemiology and pathology of RABV.
The resource can be used either via a web site or via an offline version 
aimed at more experienced bioinformaticians. The web site includes:
<ul>
<li>A curated database of NCBI RABV <a href="#/project/sequence" target="_blank">sequences</a>, with metadata.</li>
<li>A curated database of RABV <a href="#/project/alignment" target="_blank">clades</a> (genotypes, subtypes) and reference sequences.</li>
<li>Curated multiple-sequence alignments for all the NCBI sequences assigned to each clade.</li>
<li>An <a href="#analysisTool" target="_blank">analysis tool</a> supporting genotyping and interpretation of submitted consensus (FASTA) sequences.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The various datasets are integrated together in <a href="http://tools.glue.cvr.ac.uk">GLUE</a>, 
a data-centric software framework for capturing, developing and utilising nucleotide-level virus evolutionary 
hypotheses. For more information about GLUE and RABV-GLUE, please contact
