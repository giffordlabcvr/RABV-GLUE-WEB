		<h4>A Sequence Data Resource for Rabies Virus</h4>
			<p>
              Rabies virus (RABV) is a neglected zoonotic disease that causes around 59,000
              human deaths each year, with a near 100% mortality rate after the onset of symptoms. 
              The virus is a member of the Lyssavirus genus, within the Rhabdoviridae family, which
              is characterised by a single stranded, negative-sense RNA genome.
			</p>
			<p>         
              Infection with RABV can occur in all species of mammal, but up to 99% of human
              rabies cases arise from bites from infected domestic dogs. Vaccinating dogs
              to interrupt transmission is therefore paramount, and a major focus of the
              ‘Zero by 30’ global strategy to eliminate human deaths from dog-mediated rabies
              by 2030.

			<p>
			  RABV-GLUE is a data-centric bioinformatics resource which organises RABV genome sequence data along evolutionary lines. 
			  RABV-GLUE aims to leverage new and existing RABV sequences in order to improve our understanding of the epidemiology and pathology of RABV.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			  The web version of RABV-GLUE can be used for basic analysis. An offline version of the resource 
			  can be used for more advanced work.
