		<h1>RABV-GLUE</h1>
		<h4>A Sequence Data Resource for Rabies Virus</h4>
			<p>
			Rabies virus (RABV) is the virus that attacks the nervous system, causing rabies disease. 
			In the wild rabies virus has been found to infect many mammalian species.
			Rabies results in encephalitis in humans and other mammals and is almost always fatal in unvaccinated humans. 
			</p>
			<p>
			The rabies virus is the type species of the Lyssavirus genus of the Rhabdoviridae family. 
			These viruses are enveloped and have a single stranded, negative-sense RNA genome.
			</p>
			<p>
			RABV-GLUE is a data-centric bioinformatics resource which organises RABV genome sequence data along evolutionary lines. 
			RABV-GLUE aims to leverage new and existing RABV sequences in order to improve our understanding of the epidemiology and pathology of RABV.
			</p>
			<p>The web version of RABV-GLUE can be used for basic analysis. An offline version of the resource 
			can be installed by bioinformaticians and used for more advanced work.</p>
